Oops-rb
=======

Fuzzy method invocation in Ruby

Oops overrides BasicObject's method_missing function with spell-checking functionality
which attempts to find a closely matching method (by spelling) and executing it.

I'm confident that this will improve all programmer's productivity.

Known Limitations and Flaws:
* Only trys matches within edit-distance 1

Dependencies:
* damerau-levenshtein

Release History:
First Release
* Initial basic implementation.

Done for a laugh.
