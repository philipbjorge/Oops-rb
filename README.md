Note: GuessMethod is a similar package with many more features - http://guessmethod.rubyforge.org/

Fuzzy method invocation in Ruby

Oops overrides BasicObject's method_missing function with spell-checking functionality
which attempts to find a closely matching method (by spelling) and executing it.

I'm confident that this will improve all programmer's productivity.
